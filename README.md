# html-ui

Internet Explorer 11 based HTML UI component for C++.

Albeit not being extremely powerful and feature rich, due to employing Internet Explorer 11,  
html-ui offers a flexible and lightweight HTML user interface.

No external dependencies are required resulting in minuscule binary sizes.

Ideal for small, yet elegant user interfaces with limited functionality, like launchers,  
where embedding full-feldged UI frameworks is just overkill.
